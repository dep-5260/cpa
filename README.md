# Crypto Price Alert Extension

The **Crypto Price Alert** extension allows you to monitor and receive updates on cryptocurrency prices directly in your browser. With this extension, you can check the latest Bitcoin prices, 24-hour changes, high/low prices, and supply data in real-time. Additionally, you can view detailed cryptocurrency data in a dedicated page.

## Features

### 1. **Real-Time Bitcoin Price Updates**
   - The extension fetches and displays the **current price** of Bitcoin (BTC) in BTC/USD and BTC/IDR as well as the **24-hour change**.

### 2. **Popup**
   - The extension provides a popup UI that contains a button to open the extension's crypto page.

### 3. **Crypto Details Page**
   - Clicking a button in the popup opens a detailed view of the cryptocurrency data in a new browser tab (`crypto.html`).
   - You can see extended data and more detailed charts related to Bitcoin.

### 4. **Background Operation**
   - The extension runs in the background once Chrome is opened, automatically fetching the latest cryptocurrency data at regular intervals (e.g., every minute).
   - This allows the extension to keep running without the need for user interaction, providing real-time updates.

### 5. **Customizable Configuration**
   - The extension loads user configuration settings (e.g., API URLs) from a local storage file (`config.json`), making it easy to modify or update the settings as required.
